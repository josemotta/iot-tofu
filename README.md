# Iot Tofu

This is a development platform using:

- hardware based on Raspberry Pi CM4 mounted on the Tofu board, as shown below,
- a backend generated by IBM LoopBack4 framework, and
- a frontend based on HomeAssistant framework as an example.

- Based on [raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html#using-pxetools) but the network is supposed to be already set.

- The main network is composed of 'regions'.
- Each 'region' has a local LAN that includes the Tofu itself and up to dozens RPis.
- Tofu is the boot server for all RPis in the regional LAN.
- Each RPi has sensors & actuators for an Internet of Things application.
- Each region connects to the main network & then to the Internet.
- Region
  - router: dedicated LAN for Tofu & RPis (192.168.10.1)
  - dns: nameserver 127.0.0.1 to force using dnsmasq dns
- Main
  - router: connected to Internet (gateway 192.168.1.254)
  - dns: 192.168.1.254 to be set at dnsmasq server

## Boot-Back

This is the backend. It runs on the x86-64 machine for development but the final app runs on the Tofu Raspberry Pi board.

- the build action 'on push' creates the image 'josemottalopes/boot-back:latest' at docker hub
- the action uses a GitHub self-hosted runner installed at the local Tofu board

### LoopBack 4

The backend application is generated using [LoopBack 4 CLI](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html), please check out the [README](src/README.md).

As shown below, the LB4 provides automatic generation of a swagger-like frontend showing all the API details. It runs on both x86 (for development) and arm64 (for production) hardware.

## Home-Assistant

This is the frontend. It may use for example the well known [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
