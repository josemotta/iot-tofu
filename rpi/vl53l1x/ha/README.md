## VL53L1X Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser-ranging sensor.

The VL53L1X is a state-of-the-art, Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser-ranging sensor, enhancing the ST FlightSense product family. It is the fastest miniature ToF sensor on the market with accurate ranging up to 4 m and fast ranging frequency up to 50 Hz.

The Homeassistant 'distance' sensor includes a rest definition that can be appended to the current Homeassistant configuration using the commands shown below:

```
git clone https://github.com/josemotta/iot-tofu
cd iot-tofu/rpi/vl53l1x/ha
sudo install-ha.sh

```

This is an example of a typical [configuration](configuration.yaml) file, expected to be **installed at RPIs** with proper sensor, not at Tofu boot server. It also extracts raw sensors data (temperature & current) from files as part of the sysfs interface. The HomeAssistant Overview page for VL53L1X Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser-ranging sensor is shown below.

### Light interference

A test near a window, even without direct sun exposure, shows that VL53L1X sensor is affected by daylight, ranging from small variations of 1 cm during the night until up to 5 cm during the day time. The sensor shown below was aimed at the ceiling to measure a 2.2 m distance.

### Prototype for burn-in tests

A custom 3D printed case was built for five prototypes, two of them are shown below:

- Rpi#5 is loose & disconnected on the right side, showing the RJ-45 connector that powers & connects it to the local LAN. It shows also the external USB pen drive, needed to store the Docker containers that do not support remote boot disk.

- To the left, Rpi#1 prototype is being used for burn in tests and is expected to participate in the first official mission. It is fixed by DIN rail inside the waterproof pink plastic box. It is wired to PoE+ switch together with Tofu and both are powered by local LAN, up to 100 meters away from PoE+ LAN switch. There are also four RJ-45 connectors in the 3D printed case specially designed for I2C pins to connect the VL53L1X sensor and/or other I2C devices.

- Looking up, on the top of a wood stick, we see the VL53L1X sensor protected by a plastic cover. It is supposed to be installed on the top of a big tank, pointing down to measure the water level continuously 24 hours a day. Up to 5 meters away from Rpi#1 Raspberry Pi, current tests are running fine to propagate the I2C bus to the process.

### Screenshots

The first image show the results generated by the RPI4 running the following tasks for Homeassistant:

- keep measuring ´distance´ each couple seconds using the web API created for VL53L1X;
- keep updating 8 other homeassistant ´sensors´ with performance measures each 5 seconds;
- Homeassistant processes data input and stores it to be retrived later by frontend graphs.
- show homeassistant frontend webpages, browsed directly at local LAN using RPi IP;

The web browser is running at Tofu, since it has access to all RPis in the local LAN under his 'boot' reign. A remote command window is opened using 'ssh rpi1' and after running the ´htop' process viewer, with its known black screen, we can check the load average composed by three numbers. It indicates how much the CPU is being utilized, for example, at RPi quad-core processor, a load average of 4.0 means 100% CPU utilization. The numbers we see are 0.37 for the last minute, 0.29 for the last 5-minutes, and 0.26 for the last 15-minutes. This is an indication that big load improvements are still allowed for the Raspberry Pi, handling images from a camera for example.

![Homeassistant PoE+ Fan Speed](vl53l1x-ha-fanspeed.png)

Check in the last couple images that after more jobs running at RPi, the CPU temperature increase was automatically controlled by raising the fan speed to 255 rpm. As well, later at night the temperature lowered and the fan speed was reduced to 64 rpm.
